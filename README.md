### What is otiose?
It is a game written in C# 
Most of all it is a work in progress and is something I work on as a hobby to practice programming.  


### Goals of the project
+ Anyone with a windows or linux machine should be able to do a `git clone` 
and have the entire solution compiled from source and playing in minutes.
+ Have documentation so that anyone interested in the project could get an overall 
idea of the underlying systems involved by reading the `README.md` files located throughout
